## Overview

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this analysis, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Data [58 MB]

## Variable Descriptions

Each record in the dataset contains:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
